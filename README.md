<h2>🔥 What is an HWID Ban?</h2>
<p>An <strong>HWID ban</strong> blocks your device’s hardware from accessing the game. Unlike account bans, HWID bans blacklist your PC's unique identifiers like disk serials, MAC addresses, and registry GUIDs—making standard unbans useless.</p>

<h3>1. Uninstall the Game & Clean All Files</h3>
<p>Removing every trace of a game installation is one of the first and most crucial steps when dealing with an HWID ban. This includes more than just dragging the game to the trash — it involves clearing hidden files, registry entries, and system logs that anti-cheat software may still use to track your system. Most games, especially those using advanced anti-cheat systems, leave behind files and fingerprints that persist even after uninstallation. Cleaning these residual elements ensures you aren’t instantly re-flagged once you reinstall the game. Third-party uninstaller tools can help with this by scanning for leftover data that normal uninstallers miss, giving you a fresh slate to work with.</p>

<h3>2. Change Your Registry HWIDs</h3>
<p>When you're trying to bypass an HWID ban, the Windows registry becomes a major area of interest. It contains system-specific identifiers like the MachineGuid and HwProfileGuid, which many games and anti-cheat systems use to flag banned devices. Changing these values essentially gives your system a new identity, making it harder for anti-cheat software to detect that you’re the same person who was previously banned. It’s important to approach this step with caution—registry edits can affect the stability of your system if done incorrectly. Spoofing tools like TraceX typically automate these changes safely, allowing you to proceed without risking your Windows installation.</p>

<h3>3. Spoof Disk Serial Numbers</h3>
<p>Your hard drive and SSD have unique serial numbers that anti-cheat systems often use as part of their HWID ban enforcement. These identifiers are particularly persistent because they don't usually change unless manually altered. Spoofing disk serial numbers helps break the chain of identification, giving you another layer of anonymity. However, not all spoofers effectively change every drive’s information, especially external or secondary storage. A proper HWID spoofer will update disk IDs across all connected storage devices to ensure you’re not tracked by any one piece of hardware. This step is essential for a complete hardware identity reset.</p>

<h3>4. Change All System HWIDs</h3>
<p>Beyond just disk serials and registry keys, there are numerous hardware components with unique IDs—your CPU, motherboard, RAM, GPU, and more. Games with robust anti-cheat systems can use any of these as tracking markers. Changing all system HWIDs ensures you aren’t leaving a detectable trail behind. This process may sound intimidating, but tools like TraceX simplify it with automated scripts that spoof all identifiable hardware at once. While manual spoofing is possible, it's time-consuming and prone to errors. Automating this ensures consistency and reduces the risk of missing a key identifier.</p>

<h3>5. Change Your MAC Address</h3>
<p>Your MAC (Media Access Control) address is a hardware identifier assigned to your network adapter. It’s often used in combination with other system identifiers to track banned users. Since it's tied directly to your internet connection, even a perfect spoof of internal hardware can still be flagged if your MAC address remains unchanged. Thankfully, MAC addresses are relatively easy to spoof or change, either manually or using free tools. Changing it adds another layer of disguise to your system and is an important part of any effective HWID ban bypass process.</p>

<h3>6. Create or Buy a New Game Account</h3>
<p>Once your hardware identifiers are spoofed, you'll still need a clean game account to access servers again. Creating a new account isn’t just about picking a new username — it also means avoiding recycled credentials, using new emails, and preferably new phone numbers. Some players opt to purchase verified accounts from third-party sellers for convenience. Just make sure the source is reliable to avoid scams or pre-flagged accounts. Whether you’re buying or creating a new account, keeping it separate from any previously banned identities is key to staying under the radar.</p>

<h3>7. Change Your Monitor ID</h3>
<p>Although it’s less common, some advanced anti-cheat systems go as far as logging your monitor’s serial number. It may seem excessive, but developers have increasingly turned to obscure hardware signatures to make bans more persistent. Fortunately, spoofing your monitor ID is fairly straightforward and can be done with lightweight tools like CRU (Custom Resolution Utility). Taking this extra step might feel like overkill, but when it comes to HWID bans, thoroughness often determines success. Even if the chances are low, modifying your monitor’s identity helps eliminate every possible tracking method.</p>

<h3>8. Hide USB Peripheral Serials</h3>
<p>While rare, some manual bans go so far as to include the serial numbers of USB devices like keyboards, mice, or controllers. These peripherals can be used as identifying factors, especially in niche or smaller communities where manual moderation is common. Spoofing or hiding these serials helps prevent even the most aggressive detection methods from flagging your system again. This process typically involves denying read access to serials in the Windows Registry so the game cannot retrieve or log them. It’s a precautionary measure, but one that adds a final layer of invisibility.</p>

<h3>9. Reinstall & Play</h3>
<p>After all hardware and system identifiers have been changed or hidden, you’re ready to reinstall the game. This is the moment of truth—if everything has been spoofed correctly and no traces remain from your previous ban, you should be able to play without issues. It’s important to use your new account and avoid linking any old credentials, emails, or behaviors that could trigger suspicion. A successful spoofing session should make you look like a brand-new player from the game’s perspective, effectively bypassing your HWID ban and letting you enjoy the game again, stress-free.</p>
